# Space-Data-Analysis
The Space Race datasets used in this analysis was obtained from kaggle and it includes all the space missions since the beginning of Space Race (1957).

Datasets: https://www.kaggle.com/agirlcoding/all-space-missions-from-1957/code

The inferences I analysed in this datasets are;
1. Firstly, letâ€™s analyze how many missions were successfully launched and how many of them were failures using countplot and pie chart.

2. Analyze the status of mission rockets.

3. Now I would analyze based on the country that has launched a space mission.

4. Analysis based on the company who manufactured

5. Classifying the database on success and failure of the mission by the most popular companies.

6. Analyze the yearly and monthly distribution of space missions (launch)
